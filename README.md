## My project: Imperial - Metric units' converter based on FCC assignment 

On the front-end,

- `views/index.pug` to render one page app
- `public/script.js` is the javacript that runs when you load the webpage and sends your input through AJAX to the server
- `public/style.css` is the styles for `views/index.html`
- Using Pug templating technology to manage web visualization

On the back-end,

- app initialized at `server.js`
- get request routing handled in `routes/api.js`
- request data processed in `controllers/converter.js`
- data sent to the client and handled via AJAX on front-end
